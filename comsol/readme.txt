Comsol files *.mph allow to reproduce the three simulation tests included in the paper

- main_test.mph for the simulation test in the main manuscript (Fig. 6 & Suppl. Sim. Fig. 2)
- suppl_test_1.mph for the first test in the supplementary material (Suppl. Sim. Fig. 3)
- suppl_test_2.mph for the second test in the supplementary material (Suppl. Sim. Fig. 4)

Each Comsol file allows to generate all the figures included in the paper for the corresponding simulation test

All the files in this repository were created and run in COMSOL Multiphysics v6.1
